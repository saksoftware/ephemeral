No nonsense. **Huge** functionality. **Tremendous** relays. **America-first** engineering (runs on Linux, macOS, and Windows — we love all of them).

## What is this thing? (Spoiler: it’s incredible)

**ephemeral** (powered by **DPE Corp**) is a terminal Nostr chat client. Lightweight. Fast. Highly functional. You get real chat rooms, real speed, real retro hacker vibes — **from the comfort of your terminal**. Other clients? Fine. This one? **On another level.**

Smart relay management keeps you connected. **Nobody** wants a slow relay. We find the good ones. We use the good ones. **That’s how winning is done.**

## Features — and they’re ALL winners

* **Terminal UI:** Clean. Keyboard-driven. Runs **anywhere**. *Beautiful.*
* **Smart Relay Management (the best):**
    * Measures latency — **only the fastest** relays make the cut.
    * Drops unstable relays. **Failing relays?** You’re fired.
    * Publishes to the fastest path — messages fly. **Believe me.**
* **Multi-Protocol Support:** Built for many Nostr chat `kinds`. **Big league.**
* **Geohash Chats:** Ephemeral local vibes via `georelay`. **Huge.**
* **Stylish Theme:** Hacker aesthetic. Readable. **Classy.**

On join or chat switch, the client asks relays for messages from the **last 10 minutes** (up to 2000 events per room). Override in `config.json`: `"history_lookback_minutes": 15` (max 1440).
